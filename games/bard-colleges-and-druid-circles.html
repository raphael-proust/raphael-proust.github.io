<h1 class="title">Bard Colleges and Druid Circles</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">Bard and Druid subclasses for 5th Edition Dungeons
&amp; Dragons</h2>
</div>
<p>I just published <a
href="http://www.dmsguild.com/product/233071/Bard-Colleges-Bard-Subclasses"><em>Bard
Colleges</em></a> and <a
href="http://www.dmsguild.com/product/233075/Druid-Circle-Druid-Subclasses"><em>Druid
Circles</em></a>, a set of subclasses for Bards and Druids in 5th
Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons, on the <a
href="http://www.dmsguild.com/">Dungeon Masters Guild</a>. It offers
options for Bard and Druid characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>the College of Dance,</li>
<li>the College of the Circus,</li>
<li>the Circle of Bark and Leaves, and</li>
<li>the Circle of Holism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mechanically, these options try to fill gaps in character creation
possibilities. The College of Dance gives the Bard more martial
abilities whilst avoiding to depend on Strength. To that end, it takes
inspiration from Monk abilities – e.g., Charisma based Unarmored
Defense.</p>
<p>Bards from the College of the Circus gives a varied skill set. As
they gain more levels, these bards gain abilities that work in larger
groups of adventurers and as part of a tightly-knit group.</p>
<p>Druids from the Circle of Bark and Leaves lets druids shapeshift into
plants. These druids also become more plant-like.</p>
<p>There is some thematic overlap between the Circle of Bark and Leaves
and the recent <a
href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/unearthed-arcana/three-subclasses">Unearthed
Arcana’s Circle of Spore</a>. That overlap is small.</p>
<p>And finally, the Circle of Holism makes well balanced Druids that
carry tiny beasts and let moss grow on their armour.</p>
