<h1 class="title">Zelda’s puzzles</h1>
</div>
<p>A few months ago I played <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Phantom_Hourglass">Phantom
Hourglass</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Spirit_Tracks">Spirit
Tracks</a>. Currently, I am playing <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time_3D">Ocarina
of Time</a>.</p>
<h2 id="puzzles">Puzzles</h2>
<p>One of the game elements of Zelda is puzzles. There are many kinds of
puzzles: move a block so that it continuously presses down on a switch,
change the water level so you can hop from floating block to floating
block, bring the appropriate item to the appropriate place, etc.</p>
<p>Many of those puzzles are spatial puzzles: you solve them by
developing an understanding of where things are, how rooms connect
together, what parts can move in what direction. Most puzzles are also
related to different objects. For example, until you acquire the
boomerang, some switches remain out of reach.</p>
<h2 id="enemies-as-puzzles">Enemies as puzzles</h2>
<p>In Zelda games, some enemies are also puzzles – this is especially
true of bosses.</p>
<p>First, you have a range of weapons and tools at your disposal: a
sword, a shield, a boomerang, a bow, etc. The precise list depends on
which game in the series you are playing and at what point in the game
you are.</p>
<p>Second, different enemies are vulnerable to different weapons.
Additionally, some enemies are only vulnerable at certain times (e.g.,
just after they attack), in specific areas (e.g., the eyes), or under
specific conditions (e.g., once stunned).</p>
<p>Thus, defeating an enemy consist mostly of finding the right
combination of weapon/tool, timing and area. In the case where a
specific condition is required, this becomes a two step puzzle: find the
combination that triggers the required condition and the combination
that works after that.</p>
<h2 id="solving-problems-and-solving-puzzles">Solving problems and
solving puzzles</h2>
<p>Solving puzzles is fun: there is one solution to the puzzle and you
get to solve it by understanding what the designer was thinking when
they created it. Plus you get a few hints so you’re not just hitting
switches at random until it works. And for the whole time, you know
there is a solution.</p>
<p>The fact that “there is a solution” is what makes puzzle solving
different from problem solving. A problem can have any number of
solutions – hopefully at least one.</p>
<p>Solving problems is fun: there are different ways to approach a
problem and you get to solve it by understanding the whole problem
space. You sometimes have to think outside the box – i.e., think of
possible solutions the designer had not envisioned. And amongst
different solutions, you can chose one that you prefer.</p>
<h2 id="solving-problems-in-video-games">Solving problems in video
games</h2>
<p>In some video games you solve problems (rather than puzzles).</p>
<p>In <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_%28video_game%29">Deus
Ex</a> you can approach each level in multiple ways. And more
importantly for problem solving: you get to use the environment in
consistent ways. For example, some blocks can be carried and dropped.
You can</p>
<ul>
<li>use these blocks to build a climbable structure and gain access to a
building through a window,</li>
<li>use these blocks to force a patrol to change route,</li>
<li>use these blocks to block the view of a CCTV,</li>
<li>use these blocks along with proximity triggered explosives for a
trap,</li>
<li>drop these blocks from a window to make some noise in the courtyard
so that guards go and check it out</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this game, you have some tools/weapons, environment elements,
predictable AIs for game characters, a simplified version of the laws of
physics, and some objectives to accomplish. How you use the
tools/weapons, environment, AIs, and physics to accomplish your
objectives is up to your imaginations. You can even ignore the
environment altogether and rush in all guns blazing!</p>
<h2 id="solving-problems-in-games">Solving problems in games</h2>
<p>Video games have limitations: their simulation of physics is a crude
approximation, the enemy AIs follow specific rules, etc. Whilst these
limitations are pushed, they are still noticeable.</p>
<p>A way to go beyond these limitations is to replace the simulation
agent (the computer simulating the physics and the AIs) by a human: play
a role-playing game around a table. (Arguably, you trade the computer’s
limitation for the limitations of a group of people.)</p>
<p>In a role-playing game, characters have skills (tools) and
motivations (objectives). The players use the former to accomplish the
latter. The game master provides a simulation of the world based on the
rules.</p>

<p>Update from 2019-07-22</p>
<h2 id="breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</h2>
<p>The latest game in the Zelda series, Breath of the Wild (BotW),
breaks with the puzzling tradition of former Zelda games. BotW has a
game engine where fire spreads, rocks fall, balloons float up, lightning
strikes metal, etc. The physics/chemistry engine is even intertwined
with the <em>magic</em> (or, indistinguishably, otherworldly technology)
whereby objects momentum can be zeroed and set anew.</p>
<p>There are still some puzzles in BotW. Most notably the shrines tend
to offer a single solution to a relatively well-defined problem. But by
and large the game is about problem- (rather than puzzle-) solving.</p>
<p>Even enemy encounters are problems that have many solutions. All of
the properties of the physics/chemistry engine mentioned above can be
used in a fight: set fire to the grass on which enemies awaits, send
rocks tumbling down onto an enemy camp, attach some balloons to an
explosive barrel, throw a metal weapon onto an enemy just as lightning
is about to strike.</p>
