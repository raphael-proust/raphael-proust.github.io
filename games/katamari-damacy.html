</div>
<p>The video game <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari">Katamari Damacy</a> (and
the other instalments in the eponymous series) puts you in control of
the Prince of the Cosmos and in charge of collecting lots and lots of
objects. You collect these objects by rolling around a ball called
<em>Katamari</em>. When you roll the ball onto a small enough object, it
sticks to the ball, which becomes bigger, which can be rolled onto
bigger objects, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>The story, like the mechanics, is a bit absurd and endearing: you are
collecting these objects to transform them into stars to fill up the
sky</p>
<p>Some gameplay spoilers ahead.</p>
<h2 id="basics-of-katamari-rolling">Basics of Katamari rolling</h2>
<p>You start with a 5cm diameter Katamari. At this stage, you can only
roll up thumbtacks, matches, dice, etc. When you bump into, say, a
bottle of water, it might as well be a wall: you bounce back.</p>
<p>As you roll up those small objects with the Katamari, it gets bigger.
Soon you can roll up leaves, cutlery, orange quarters, etc. The water
bottle now wobbles when you bump into it.</p>
<p>As you roll up those slightly less small objects with the Katamari,
it gets even bigger. You start to roll up whole fruits, small books,
shoes, and, pretty soon, water bottles.</p>
<p>The game mechanics are a bit more complicated than that. And there
would be a lot to say about the controls (the pushing, the directions,
the intertia) and the view. But we’ll focus on the Katamari size and
growth.</p>
<h2 id="the-sweet-nerdiness-of-rolling-the-katamari">The sweet nerdiness
of rolling the Katamari</h2>
<p>There are several dynamics that emerge from the mechanics of rolling
the Katamari that I find very interesting. Two of them very nerdy and
mathematical.</p>
<p>First, there is the exponential growth. The bigger the Katamari, the
bigger the objects that the Katamari can collect, the faster the
Katamari can grow. The Katamari dynamics include a snowball effect that
is almost literal.</p>
<p>Second, this exponential growth is tampered by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law">the
square-cube law</a> — although in this case, it is the linear-cube law.
Whilst rolling up objects increases the volume of the Katamari, the
measure of its size is by its diameter. So, roughly, if it takes you 10
thumbtacks to go from 5cm to 10cm, it’ll take 80 thumbtacks to get you
from 10cm to 15cm. This encourages you to seek newer and newer objects:
it’ll take you only 40 chopsticks!</p>
<p>The balance of these two dynamics is interesting. The specific inner
working of the linear-cube law are probably tweaked, the game engine
probably approximates it with just enough of a lie to improve the
gameplay.</p>
<h2 id="the-strange-thoughts-from-rolling-the-katamari">The strange
thoughts from rolling the Katamari</h2>
<p>The other dynamic I find interesting is one on the philosophical
side: the eventual growth of the Katamari makes the very definition of
“object” a bit shaky.</p>
<p>You start inside a home rolling up some small things, you then go in
the garden to roll up small plants and small animals, you then go into
the alley to roll up buckets and tricycles, you then go into the street
to roll up some benches and vending machines, etc. As you go along,
anything that was once an obstacle eventually becomes something you can
collect. And whilst it might sound like an obvious truth of the game,
this truth applies to a greater extent than you are lead to believe in
the first few levels of the game.</p>
<p>Indeed, by the end of the game, you can roll up the very house that
you started in. You can then roll up entire neighbourhoods, and then
skyscrapers and factories, and eventually islands, clouds, volcanoes,
storms, etc.</p>
<p>There is a weird philosophical twist to the game:<br />
What is and isn’t an object is just a matter of scale; watch what
happens when you grow beyond the scale of humans!</p>
