<h1 class="title">Hacking in Cryptomancer</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">When not to include a character option in a role
playing game</h2>
</div>
<h2 id="players-and-characters">Players and Characters</h2>
<p>Some time ago, I wrote <a href="/misc/genre-and-setting.html">a short
post about genre and setting</a>. In it I mentioned the difficulty of
running a detective story in a generic role playing games (RPGs)
system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A detective story] is a somewhat more difficult story to adapt to
role-playing games because it relies on the players’ ability for
deduction. This means that the player – rather than the character – is
doing the detective work. It would render the whole thing very boring to
ask players to roll for deduction instead of letting them solve the
mystery at hand.</p>
<p>This means that the role-playing aspect of such a game shouldn’t
involve too much game mechanics. It cannot be played in all rule
systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When playing an RPG, the Player sits around the table and makes
decisions about their Character’s action. Player and Character are
distinct. This imposes limits on what RPGs can do – as per discussion
about detective stories above.</p>
<p>However, each RPG system distributes responsibilities to Player and
Character in its own way.</p>
<h2 id="cryptomancer">Cryptomancer</h2>
<p>More recently, I’ve started to look up non-D&amp;D RPGs. I’m both
trying to find other games to play (D&amp;D falls short in a lot of
places) and learn about other mechanics out of mere curiosity.</p>
<p>One game I stumbled upon is Cryptomancer. A classic fantasy setting
(Dwarves, Elves, and Humans, Magic, Swords, and Castles, etc.) with the
addition of cryptomancy: the magical practice of cryptography. This
magic takes the form of spells to encrypt, sign, decrypt, or
authenticate messages.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Cryptomancer has no <em>hacking</em> skill. From the
rule book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no “hacking” or “information security” skill available to
characters by design. That’s because instead of rolling dice and saying
“I hack the things,” players will instead be saying “I will use the
keyphrase I interrogated out of our prisoner to impersonate him and send
a message to his comrades to meet at the old windmill, where our trap
will be set.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, all the information security in Cryptomancer is done
by the Player. It is not merely a Player’s mechanical choice that
results in a Character’s success/failure (e.g., “I attack the goblin” is
followed by the player rolling dice rather than swinging a sword), but
it is the Player’s doing entirely.</p>
<h2
id="drawbacks-advantages-considerations-and-open-questions">Drawbacks,
advantages, considerations and open questions</h2>
<p>I haven’t played a game of Cryptomancer yet. I’ll try to get a group
of players together and run a short campaign. But in the meantime, I
have started planning. And as part of the planning, I am considering
what to do with this deliberate lack of <em>hacking</em> skill, how to
leverage it and what to watch out for.</p>
<h3 id="cryptography-novices">Cryptography novices</h3>
<p>What if some players are complete novice to cryptography?
Cryptomancer seems like a good game for players to learn the
fundamentals and to think about different uses and implications of
cryptography. But how much would they enjoy the game?</p>
<p>In general, if a part of the game is the responsibility of the player
rather than the character, how do you ensure that players with various
competence in that part of the game still enjoy it.</p>
<p>In the same area of concern: When the players have mixed level of
understanding of cryptography, how to make sure everyone enjoys the
experience?</p>
<p>To some extent, there’s no unique answer to these questions and it
depends on the group composition. And in addition, it might be that some
players will not enjoy the do-it-yourself cryptography and that
Cryptomancer is not a game for them.</p>
<h3 id="full-immersion">Full immersion</h3>
<p>Because the Player-Character boundary is shifted somewhat, it can
lead to more immersion for the players. That is, by putting more
responsibility on the Player themselves, by giving some of the
Character’s responsibility to the Player, it can lead to the Player
feeling like a more integral part of the in-game universe. I say “can
lead” because it’s not automatic, it must be worked into the play.</p>
<p>There is a meme that goes along the lines of “Press X to pay
respect”, poking fun at the immersion-breaking overuse of
character-centric mechanics.</p>
<p>For most groups playing most RPGs, the players speak the words of
their character. That is there is no skill for <em>speak</em>,
<em>converse</em>, or <em>dialogue</em>. Except that there often sort of
is: D&amp;D has <em>deception</em>, <em>intimidation</em>, and
<em>persuasion</em> skills. These skills feel strange to use: there are
no consequences for a player delivering convincing versus unconvincing
lines to an NPC, instead, the result is determined by a dice roll. It
somewhat breaks the immersion, the feeling of being involved in an
unfolding story, when a NPC accepts really bad arguments.</p>
<p>Generally, D&amp;D has lacklustre rules concerning social
interactions and it takes a good DM to work around the mechanical
limitations. Maybe, D&amp;D should not have any Charisma skills?</p>
<h3 id="fantasy-challenge-discovery">Fantasy, Challenge, Discovery</h3>
<p>The absence of hacking skills in Cryptomancer is a design decision
about Mechanics. And as all decisions about Mechanics, it affects
Dynamics and ultimately Æsthetics – using the
Mechanics-Dynamics-Æsthetics (MDA) framework<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
Some æsthetics to watch out for:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fantasy</em> (Game as make-believe) As mentioned above,
Cryptomancer’s approach to hacking can enhance immersion which
reinforces Fantasy.</li>
<li><em>Challenge</em> (Game as obstacle course) Because hacking becomes
a player’s responsibility, it becomes a different challenge, a more
direct and tactical one.</li>
<li><em>Discovery</em> (Game as uncharted territory) The player being
drawn in-game to complete cryptography-related tasks makes the
cryptography an uncharted territory that needs exploring. This loops
back to the use of Cryptomancer as a teaching tool for
cryptography.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flexible-player-character-boundaries">Flexible Player-Character
boundaries</h2>
<p>Cryptomancer is not the only TTRPG to give the players the
responsibilities for a core skill, and TTRPGs are not the only games to
do so.</p>
<h3 id="video-games">Video Games</h3>
<p>In video games, character actions are under more or less direct
control of the player. E.g., in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,
the player is in direct control of the positioning of Link but the same
player only instruct Link on what ingredients to mix together. The
former involves somewhat direct controls (albeit positioning is a
function of movement which is arguably somewhat indirectly controlled by
the player) whereas the latter involves very indirect controls (choosing
ingredients is not cooking). In other words, positioning (unlike
cooking) is the responsibility of the player, not of Link.</p>
<p>Less well known but more to the point, <a
href="/games/a-normal-lost-phone.html">A Normal Lost Phone</a> smashes
the in-game out-of-game boundary by presenting the in-game Lost Phone as
a mock interface on the Player’s out-of-game actual phone. As a Player,
you tap on the screen of your phone to control an in-game phone. The
bulk of the responsibilities is shifted to the Player.</p>
<h3 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h3>
<p>Video games generally have a fixed set of Player responsibilities and
Character responsibilities. Table top RPGs tend to have a more fluid
separation of responsibility. The game master can skip a whole shopping
sequence or montage a travel sequence when the stakes are relatively
low, and decide to involve the players when the stakes are high. E.g.,
if the party is wanted by the authorities, then maybe shopping starts by
locating a merchant that might be sympathetic and continues by finding
the right words to convince them to accept the party as customers.</p>
<h2 id="remarksquestions-to-end-this-post">Remarks/Questions to end this
post</h2>
<p>Some responsibilities cannot be given to the Player (e.g., casting
spells), and some should not be given to the Player (e.g., the use of
weaponry). Arguably, some responsibilities cannot be given to the
Character (e.g., agency), and some should not (e.g., see remark about
detective stories above).</p>
<p>As a game designer, how to decide the distribution of
responsibilities?</p>
<p>As a DM, how to leverage the distribution to improve the game?</p>
