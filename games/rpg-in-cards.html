<h1 class="title">It’s all in the cards</h1>
</div>
<p>This post discusses the use of cards as an alternative mechanic to
dice in RPGs. Cards can provide randomness – hence, they can be used to
keep players in check like dice do.</p>
<p>Additionally, cards mechanics are rich and varied – richer and more
varied than dice mechanics. This variety can be used to design
interesting mechanics; notably mechanics that match the theme of the
game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this richness and variety comes at a cost: complexity.
This is also discussed below.</p>
<h2 id="hand-deck-discard-draw-recycle-play-etc.">Hand, deck, discard,
draw, recycle, play, etc.</h2>
<p>Unlike dice mechanics which can be neatly summarised and even
expressed in a compact notation, card mechanics are more complex and use
a more extended vocabulary.</p>
<h3 id="areas">Areas</h3>
<p>To start with, cards mechanics use the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>hand</em> is a set of cards a player holds,</li>
<li>the <em>deck</em> is a set of cards from which the player gets new
cards,</li>
<li>the <em>discard</em> (or <em>discard pile</em>) is a set of cards in
which the player places one-use-cards after they are played, and</li>
<li>the <em>mat</em> is a set of cards in which the player places cards
that have a lasting effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the mat can be divided into arbitrarily many sub-areas –
e.g., in PTCG a one card slot for the active pokémon, a five card slot
for the benched pokémon, a shared slot for a stadium. Additionally, some
cards can only be played in some areas and some cards can be attached to
other cards.</p>
<h3 id="flows">Flows</h3>
<p>Cards flow from one area to another via different mechanics. The most
common are</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Drawing</em>: move cards from the deck to your hand.</li>
<li><em>Playing</em>: move cards from your hand into either the discard
or (an area of) the mat.</li>
<li><em>Destroying</em>: move cards from the mat to the discard.</li>
<li><em>Discarding</em>: move cards from the hand to the discard (and
ignore their effect).</li>
</ul>
<p>But any other flow is possible. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Resurecting</em>: move cards from the discard onto the mat.</li>
<li><em>Recycling</em>: move cards from the discard into the deck.</li>
<li><em>Returning</em>: move cards from the discard into your hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some games, it is even possible to steal opponents cards, play
cards from their decks to apply the effect for yourself, or other such
mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="general-mechanics-and-specific-mechanics">General mechanics and
specific mechanics</h3>
<p>In card rule systems, there are mechanics that apply to the game in
general and mechanics that are specific to certain cards.</p>
<p>The core mechanics involve drawing, discarding, etc. They are
affected by parameters such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial hand size: the number of cards you start with.</li>
<li>Hand limit: the maximum number of cards you can have in your
hand.</li>
<li>Play limit: the maximum number of cards you can play in one
turn.</li>
<li>Draw size: the number of cards you draw on each turn.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, each card can have specific mechanics: instructions
that, when followed, modify the state of the game. For example, some
cards allow you to search your deck for a specific card, some cards
allow you to draw more cards, some cards change the maximum hand-size
when on the mat, some cards allow you to play the top card of the deck
straight into play, etc.</p>
<h4 id="aside-classic-card-games-vs-tcgs-ccgs-and-the-like">Aside:
classic card games vs TCGs, CCGs and the like</h4>
<p>In classic card games (e.g., poker) there are only (or mostly)
general mechanics. In TCGs, CCGs and similar games, there are both
general mechanics and rules for each cards. This is where the richness
and complexity of card rules come from.</p>
<h2 id="mechanics-with-a-flavour">Mechanics with a flavour</h2>
<p>Cards have much richer mechanics than dice. Whilst richer mechanics
can increase complexity (as discussed below) which can be detrimental to
play (also discussed below), it also provides opportunities for game
system design.</p>
<p>An opportunity given by cards mechanics is to give flavour to the
mechanics: to map the characters’ abilities and personalities into the
mechanics of the game. This can be done to a greater extent than with
dice. Indeed, rolling dice for damage when you play a Barbarian or a
Thief feels the same (the main difference is the sidedness of the dice)
even though the characters would attack very differently.</p>
<p>On the other hand, playing differently coloured decks in MTG feels
very different. The card arts, names and descriptions contribute to this
difference, but the mechanics contribute as well. In an MTG deck, black
magic cards often resurrect creatures from the graveyard – or, in
mechanics term, make cards flow from the discard onto the mat. This
mechanic has flavour: the discard is a graveyard from which you raise
the dead!</p>
<p>These mechanics with a flavour can be applied to RPGs. Here are a few
possible examples. These are only to give an idea, they are not polished
and they have not been play-tested.</p>
<h3 id="example-a-few-barbarian-cards">Example: a few barbarian
cards</h3>
<div style="border: solid #aaa 1px;">
<dl>
<dt><strong>Berserk</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Put this card in play and discard the rest of your hand. When this
card is in play at the beginning of your turn, reveal three cards from
the top of your deck. Resolve the revealed attack cards immediately
against the closest opponent. Discard the other cards. If there are no
attack cards, destroy the berserk card, draw one card and finish your
turn.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Brutal attack</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Search your deck for an attack card. Deal 5 damage plus the damage
from the selected attack to an opponent.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Swing</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Deal 5 damage to an opponent. Search your deck for an attack card and
resolve it immediately against an adjacent opponnent.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>When a character goes berserk, they abandon all control over the
actions of their character. The card mechanics mimic the state of
abandonment to violence that the character is living. As a result, the
player is forced into the character’s state: they have to give up
control just like their character.</p>
<p>Additionally, when the character has no opportunities to attack (when
they draw no attack cards), they calm down. Whilst this event might seem
random, its likelihood is affected by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How <strong>focused on offense</strong> the character is.
Specifically, the character might pick up different non-attack skills
(e.g., dodging). Each of those skills adds cards in the player’s deck.
They dilute the attack cards which decreases the chance of finding
attack cards which, in turn, increases the likelihood of interrupting
the berserk state.</li>
<li>How <strong>tired</strong> the character is. For example, the player
might have played several Brutal attack or Swing cards. These actions
reduce the amount of attack cards in the player’s deck which, again,
increases the likelihood of interrupting the berserk. The character gets
tired of brutally swinging their axe around which reduces the duration
of their bouts of rage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, note that when going berserk, the player discards their
hand. At the end of their character’s bout of rage, they draw a single
card. This mimics the weariness following a period of intense rage. It
takes a bit of time for the character to get back on track, to recover
and regain agency. Similarly, it takes a few turns for the player to
draw more cards and have options.</p>
<p>Note that, the character, either through levelling up or through
other progression methods, may acquire better berserk cards. For
example, one that allows them to draw more than three cards. Or one that
allows them to draw more cards at the end of their berserk.</p>
<h3 id="example-different-kinds-of-magic">Example: different kinds of
magic</h3>
<p>The magic of a sorcerer is wild, it feeds on impulses and emotions. A
sorcerer casts spur-of-the-moment spells. On the other hand, a wizard is
a measured, rational, wise individual. The wizard chooses spells
carefully, even if that means casting spells less frequently. Where the
sorcerer is unpredictable, the wizard is measured. Both dangerous, but
each in their own way.</p>
<p>A player with a sorcerer character is given a low starting hand size
(say, three), a low maximum hand size (say, also three), a moderate draw
rate (say, two cards per turn), and a high play rate (say, three cards
per turn). As a result, the player can only ever chose between a few
spells – probably two or three in their hand of three – but they can
play several of them. This mimics the spur-of-the moment spellcasting
style of the sorcerer. Note that, because of the low maximum hand size
and the moderate draw rate, the sorcerer will have to discard some
spells – e.g., if they could not be cast during the turn because some
condition was not met – even if they could be useful in later turns.</p>
<p>A player with a wizard character is given a high starting hand size
(say, five or six), a high maximum hand size (say, eight or ten), a low
draw rate (say, one card per turn) and a low play rate (say, one car per
turn). As a result, the player has many spells to chose from – probably
four or more in their initial hand – but can only play one of them. This
mimics the measured, thought-out spell-casting of the wizard.</p>
<p>These flavour differences can be further pronounced by the additions
of a few cards. For example, the sorcerer can be given any of the cards
described below. They all have a mechanic that makes the outcome
potentially powerful but unpredictable.</p>
<div style="border: solid #aaa 1px;">
<dl>
<dt><strong>Gamble</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Reveal the top five cards of your deck. If three or more are spells,
play them immediately and discard the other cards. Otherwise, discard
all the revealed cards.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Of two minds</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Reveal the top two cards of your deck. Immediately play all the
spells cards revealed that way. Place the other cards at the bottom of
your deck.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>On the other hand, the wizard can be given the card below. This time,
the mechanics make the outcome entirely predictable and feel more
measured.</p>
<div style="border: solid #aaa 1px;">
<dl>
<dt><strong>Mnemonic</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Discard three spell cards from your hand. Search your deck for a
spell and place it in your hand.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>As illustrated here both the core mechanics of the card system and
the specific mechanics of the cards themselves can be used to add
flavour.</p>
<h3 id="example-sneaky-characters">Example: sneaky characters</h3>
<p>A sneaky character, be it an assassin, a thief, or a scout, stays
hidden as much as possible, is able to adapt to changing conditions and
can act or move quickly.</p>
<p>Hidden is a very different condition to maintain than berserk: it
requires control, not loss thereof. To match that difference, the player
can be required to provide additional Hide cards every turn they want to
stay hidden. Thus, like their character, the player is active; like
their character, the player is managing risk (How likely I am to draw
enough “Hide” cards to reach that thicker part of the forest?).</p>
<div style="border: solid #aaa 1px;">
<dl>
<dt><strong>Hide</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Play this card in front of you to hide. You are hidden as long as
this card is in play. At the begining of your turn, discard three Hide
cards from your hand or destroy this card and become visible.<br />
In dim light, you only need to discard two Hide cards.<br />
In darkness, you only need to discard one Hide card.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>The adaptability of sneaky characters can be baked into the card
mechanics through already mentioned processes: high draw rate, high hand
sizes, ability to search for specific cards.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-players-in-check-with-cards">Keeping players in check
with cards</h2>
<p>There are multiple ways in which cards can be used as a source of
randomness. And in turn this randomness can be used for multiple aspects
of the mechanics. This section focuses on the specific use of randomness
to keep players in check.</p>
<p>With cards, you can only play from your hand. Even though a card may
allow you to play additional cards from the deck or the discard, the
original card that lets you do that must have been in your hand to enter
play. This is one of the ways in which the cards limit the players.
Interestingly, it is the opposite of the way the dice limit the players.
Specifically, with dice, players can try anything, but their success is
uncertain; with cards, players are uncertain about what their hand will
be and thus what actions they will be able to take, but the success is
given. Thus, the dice specific choose-then-resolve style of play is
turned on its head: draw-and-choose.</p>
<p>Cards can require you to reveal the top <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> cards of the deck. The success of
a card can be tied to the content of these revealed cards. This is used
in the example Gamble card (see above) and, in a different way, in the
Berserk card. Interestingly, the success rate of such a check is tied to
the specific deck of the character. As such, the deck itself, its
composition, is constitutive of a character just as much as the
character sheets of dice based games.</p>
<p>More interestingly, the composition of the deck changes with play:
cards get drawn and discarded. This can be used to mimic characters
getting tired, being affected by conditions, etc.</p>
<h2 id="the-issue-of-complexity">The issue of complexity</h2>
<p>Compared to dice, cards offer deeper mechanics which can be used to
encode some of the flavour from different games or settings. The flip
side of that depth and richness is complexity: card rules tend to be
harder to learn and involve more special cases.</p>
<h3 id="adoption">Adoption</h3>
<p>Complexity is problematic for beginner players and more generally for
adoption.</p>
<p>However, beginner players have low-level characters. Low-level
characters have access to fewer and possibly simpler cards than
high-level characters. This means that players can learn new mechanics
progressively. For example, mechanics such as “searching the deck for a
card” can be limited to cards for characters in their third level or
higher.</p>
<p>Additionally, RPG players are used to long rule books with special
cases and emergent properties. Card games are complex, but not more
complex than Pathfinder.</p>
<h3 id="too-slow">Too slow</h3>
<p>Another problem with complexity is that it slows down play. All the
different mechanics are based on different physical actions, each taking
some time to perform. Whilst rolling dice and adding numbers is
relatively quick, searching through a deck and shuffling are not. This
is a more serious issue because it can break the fantasy – i.e., it can
negatively affect one of the core æsthetic of the game.</p>
<p>What is the point of making each player’s turn more engaging by
introducing flavours in the mechanics, if they end up spending long
spans of time waiting for others to finish their turn?</p>
<p>This can be partly mitigated by software. Specifically, if, instead
of physical cards, the players use an electronic play table (such as
Tabletop Simulator), some operations can be much faster:</p>
<ul>
<li>searching a card can be done faster, and</li>
<li>shuffling is practically instantaneous.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-gm-does-a-lot">The GM does a lot</h3>
<p>Another problem is the complexity for the GM. In most RPGs, the GM
effectively plays the role of all NPCs, be they ally or opponent. If a
GM is to manage all the opponents during a fight, they have to
effectively manage multiple hands, multiple decks, multiple play areas,
etc.</p>
<p>This can again be mitigated by software. Specifically, opponents in a
fight (or in another non-combat conflict) can be programmed to play
automatically. This requires special attention because NPCs have a
personality, imbued by the GM descriptions, acting, voicing, etc. Using
computer programs to play the NPCs may, if done poorly, impact the
fantasy æsthetics.</p>
<h2 id="issues-other-than-complexity">Issues other than complexity</h2>
<p>Dice are cheap, sturdy, reusable, generic bits of plastic; you buy a
dice set and you are good to go for almost any game. On the other hand,
cards are (relatively) expensive, easily damaged, specific tokens;
buying MTG cards gets you nowhere to play PTCG.</p>
<h2 id="prospects-and-ideas">Prospects and ideas</h2>
<p>Complexity is a major issue. There cannot be a card-based RPG with
CCG/TCG mechanics without a good solution for complexity. Mitigating
that complexity with electronics/software is difficult. It needs to be
done in a way that preserves (or enhances) the core æsthetics of RPGs:
fantasy and fellowship.</p>
<p>Another issue that needs attention is the lack of adaptive threshold
mechanism. For example, in dice-based RPGs, some enemies tend to be
harder to hit than others. With card mechanics, how can this be
replicated? There are ways to mitigate this issue, but it needs work
from game designers.</p>
<p>Finally, an interesting issue to tackle is the rate limit on some
abilities. In SRD/D&amp;D, some abilities can be used only once between
two periods of rest. This is easily done with cards: use multiple
discards. More interestingly, this gives an opportunity for an
interesting mechanic: when their deck is empty, the players shuffle
their discard to form a new deck; but before they do so, they must move
five random card from their discard into their once-a-day discard. This
mimics the character getting tired, their energy depleted.</p>
