title: Raphaël Proust
...

In my free time, I occasionally play (both as player and game master) [Dungeons and Dragons](http://dnd.wizards.com/), [Adventures in Middle-earth](http://cubicle7.co.uk/our-games/adventures-in-middle-earth/) or other role playing games.
I also enjoy the [Pokémon](http://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise, the [Zelda](https://www.zelda.com) series, most things made by [Introversion Software](http://introversion.co.uk/introversion/), [Smash Up](https://www.alderacsite.com/smash-up-home/), [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net/), and some other games.

After babbling BASIC on my CASIO graph 65, I learned [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/).
I consider it my main programming language.
I am also proficient in Python, Javascript, and Scala.
I have also been in contact with Scheme, Haskell and C.
Most of my public software contributions are on [Github](http://github.com/raphael-proust/) and on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/raphael-proust).

I speak French and English.
I started learning Chinese and Toki Pona although I am not proficient in either.
