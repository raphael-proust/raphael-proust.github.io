<h2 id="projects-at-nomadic-labs">Projects at Nomadic Labs</h2>
<p><a href="https://nomadic-labs.com/">Nomadic Labs</a> is a company that provides software development and research in formal verification, distributed systems and programming languages.</p>
<p>I joined Nomadic Labs in March 2018 as the company was expending to handle the development requirements of the <a href="https://tezos.com/">Tezos</a> project. I am still working at Nomadic Labs, on Tezos and other related projects. Some of the items below are on-going.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Code review</strong> and <strong>merging</strong></p>
<p>I reviewed merge requests (MRs): inspecting changes to the code before giving a greenlight for merging, or requesting changes, or discussing specific points with the original developers.</p>
<p>I rebased and merged MRs that had been greenlit by other reviewers.</p>
<p>I participated and, for a time, ran weekly meetings to discuss and triage open MRs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overhauling the Tezos mempool</strong></p>
<p>The mempool is a component of the Tezos project responsible for receiving information from the P2P gossip, folding the received information into the local state, and, based on state changes, handing over some more information to the P2P layer to be gossiped. A few colleagues and myself rewrote a new mempool from scratch to fix some issues and improve performance.</p>
<p>This software component involves concurrency (information is received from different peers at unpredictable times, but operations must be applied to the state sequentially) and more specifically defensive scheduling: it must protect against potential denial of service attacks whereby malicious peers saturate a node to the point that it ignores other, non-malicous, nodes. It also involves a high level of abstraction because the nature of the state and the way information is folded into it depends on another software component (the economic protocol) that can change dynamically.</p>
<p>The development of this new mempool led to the release of <a href="https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/lwt_pipeline"><code>lwt-pipeline</code></a> and the extension of <a href="https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/ringo"><code>ringo</code></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Releasing internal libraries</strong> and <strong>upstreaming changes to vendored libraries</strong></p>
<p>The Tezos project was originally built as a set of libraries and binaries all placed within the same repository. After a while, some parts of the code had matured into stable components with well-defined interfaces. These parts could be released.</p>
<p>I took the lead in releasing libraries. This involved setting up their own repository (with continuous integration), setting up the packaging boilerplate, and modifying the code of Tezos to use the external libraries rather than the embedded version.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other miscellaneous</strong></p>
<p>Work at Nomadic Labs also included developing various features, fixing some bugs, triaging issues, etc. I also developed some of the tooling used for linting.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="projects-at-cambridge-coding-academy-and-cambridge-spark">Projects at Cambridge Coding Academy and Cambridge Spark</h2>
<p><a href="https://cambridgecoding.com/">Cambridge Coding Academy</a> and <a href="https://cambridgespark.com/">Cambridge Spark</a> are twin companies that provide teaching and training in programming, data analysis, machine learning, etc. The former organises courses for teenagers; the latter for professionals.</p>
<p>I started working for the companies as they were set up. When I finished my PhD, I started full time employment for these companies and worked on the projects listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Student evaluation system</strong></p>
<p>I participated in the creation, maintenance and improvement of a system to automatically evaluate students. I also handled part of the system administration for the machines that run the system. The system analysed submitted code, recorded complete results for later review by the teachers and gave immediate summarised feedback to the students.</p>
<p>The system involved Gitlab, Python, continuous integration, linting libraries, unit testing, Docker images (both building and running), and Amazon Web Services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Course writing</strong></p>
<p>I wrote, reviewed, and edited <a href="http://cambridgecoding.com/summerschool">courses for Cambridge Coding Academy</a>. These courses, aimed at teenagers, covered basic programming, making web pages, building games, programmatically generating music, and creating artificial intelligences.</p>
<p>I wrote, reviewed, and edited <a href="https://cambridgespark.com/training">courses for Cambridge Spark</a>. These courses, aimed at professionals, covered basic programming, data-analysis, and quantitative finance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Publication pipeline</strong></p>
<p>I wrote and maintained a publication pipeline for content created by Cambridge Spark. The pipeline let authors submit content, make edits, and compile the files locally. It let reviewers make minor changes and request bigger changes. It automatically compiled the files as they were submitted and let project managers publish them online on demand.</p>
<p>The system used Pandoc, custom LaTeX templates, custom HTML templates, Makefiles, integration tests, and continuous integrations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Web development</strong></p>
<p>I contributed to the implementation of the online learning platform of Cambridge Coding Academy. The program was written in Scala and Javascript and managed users through an SQL database. The User Interface included an online editor, and rendered user-edited HTML/Javascript/CSS in the browser.</p>
<p>I contributed to two consecutive versions of the <a href="https://cambridgespark.com/">Cambridge Spark website</a>. The website, coded in Scala, used the Play and Bootstrap frameworks, an SQL database, and custom Javascript.</p>
<p>I also assisted with the system administration. The website was hosted on Amazon Web Services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Teaching</strong></p>
<p>I taught numerous courses for both teenagers (with Cambridge Coding Academy) and professionals (with Cambridge Spark) about several aspects of computer science and programming. I also trained teachers and tutors.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="projects-at-the-university-of-cambridge">Projects at the University of Cambridge</h2>
<p>I completed a PhD at the Computer Laboratory of the University of Cambridge.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>PhD</strong></p>
<p>The topic of my PhD is the use of compile-time memory management (to replace execution-time garbage collection) in the context of system programming.</p>
<p>I wrote the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-908.html">dissertation</a> in LaTeX, used <code>mk</code> to drive the compilation into pdf, and managed the source files with Git.</p>
<p>I wrote a prototype in OCaml, used <code>make</code> to drive the compilation as well as the tests and the benchmarks, and managed the source files with Git.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computer Science Laboratory</strong> (additional work)</p>
<p>I supervised undergraduate students, both in tutoring sessions and for longer projects. I organised <a href="http://talks.cam.ac.uk/user/show/25917">a series of talks</a> for my research team. I contributed to the early setup of the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/admissions-test/">Computer Science Admission Test</a> which is used to evaluate candidates to the University of Cambridge Computer Science undergraduate program.</p>
<p>I was awarded the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/local/wiseman.html">Wiseman Award</a> for these contributions to the Computer Science Laboratory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Magdalene College MCR Committee member</strong> (MCR: the body of graduate students)</p>
<p>I was Secretary, President and then IT officer of the <a href="http://mcr.magd.cam.ac.uk/">MCR</a> committee of <a href="https://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/">Magdalene College</a>. I organised events for around 100 people, represented students in College matters, and organised committee elections.</p></li>
