<p>In my free time, I occasionally play (both as player and game master)
<a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/">Dungeons and Dragons</a>, <a
href="http://cubicle7.co.uk/our-games/adventures-in-middle-earth/">Adventures
in Middle-earth</a> or other role playing games. I also enjoy the <a
href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/">Pokémon</a> franchise, the <a
href="https://www.zelda.com">Zelda</a> series, most things made by <a
href="http://introversion.co.uk/introversion/">Introversion
Software</a>, <a href="https://www.alderacsite.com/smash-up-home/">Smash
Up</a>, <a href="http://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a>, and some other
games.</p>
<p>After babbling BASIC on my CASIO graph 65, I learned <a
href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>. I consider it my main programming
language. I am also proficient, if rusty, in Python, Javascript, and
Scala. I have also been in contact with Scheme, Haskell and C. Most of
my public software contributions are on <a
href="https://gitlab.com/raphael-proust">Gitlab</a> and on <a
href="http://github.com/raphael-proust/">Github</a>.</p>
<p>I speak French, English and some Spanish. I started learning Chinese
and Toki Pona although I am not proficient in either.</p>

<h3 id="past">Past</h3>
<p>I worked as a freelance software developer and technical writer.</p>
<p>I worked for <a href="https://cambridgespark.com">Cambridge Spark</a>
and Cambridge Coding Academy(<a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200921170235/https://cambridgecoding.com/">wayback
machine link</a>) as a software developer and a course developer. I
wrote software to write, review, edit, publish, and deliver courses; I
wrote, reviewed, edited, published, and delivered courses about
software.</p>
<p>I was a Ph.D. student at the <a

href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a> under
supervision of <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/">Alan
Mycroft</a>. <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-908.html">My
thesis</a> explored the use of compile-time memory management in the
context of system programming: replacing garbage collectors by a
compilation pass in order to be friendly to system programmers.</p>
<p>I was a student of <a href="http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/">Magdalene
