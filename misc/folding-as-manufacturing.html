<h1 class="title">Folding as manufacturing</h1>
</div>
<p>There is a lot of talk of additive manufacturing, a fancy word for 3D printing. It is called “additive” because the printer <em>adds</em> material in order to form a product. Roughly, this is how masonry works: you start with a stack of bricks (definitely not a house) and you add them carefully one-by-one until you have the finished product (say, a house).</p>
<p>Additive manufacturing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing. In subtractive manufacturing a person or a machine removes material to form a product. Essentially, this is how sculpture works: you start with a big chunk of marble and you remove parts until you’re left with the Greek God that was inside all along.</p>
<p>There are other categories of construction techniques, one of them is folding manufacturing.</p>
<p>An obvious example of folding as a construction technique is origami: folding sheets of paper to create decorative figurines of animals or what have you. This endeavour is mostly known as artistic has applications in seriously serious engineering.</p>
<p>A construction technique that is less obviously part of the folding category is crochet (and knitting and other similar techniques). In crochet, you start with a 1-dimensional material (yarn) and you fold it into some sorts of knots until it reaches a form in higher dimensions (2 for a blanket, 3 for a sweater).</p>
<p>Folding manufacturing starts with a low-dimension material (1-dimensional for crochet/knitting, 2-dimensional for origami). Each step in the manufacturing process is small (a stitch in the yarn, a fold in the paper). The repetition of variations of these small steps produces a higher-dimensional product.</p>
