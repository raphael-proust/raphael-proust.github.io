<h1 class="title">Genre and Setting</h1>
</div>
<p>Books are often sorted by genre or setting: Fantasy, Science Fiction,
Murder, etc. This is true of other media as well – games included. And
in most cases, the genre and setting are barely distinguishable. This is
why, even though murders happen in Fantasy settings, there are no
Hercule Poirot in Middle-Earth, Robert Langdon aboard the Millennium
Falcon, or Indiana Jones on Wisteria Lane.</p>
<p>However, there are cases where genre and setting are at odds. One
such case is in the occasional special one-off episode of a TV series.
For example, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer">Buffy the
Vampire Slayer</a> – supernatural drama with minors in horror and
goofiness – has the episode <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer">Once More,
With Feelings</a> (2001) where the whole town cannot help but sing and
dance: it’s a musical! The setting is unchanged – the fit of singing is
caused by a demon – but the genre undoubtedly is.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laundry_files">Laundry
Files</a> book series by Charles Stross has a Lovecraftian horror
setting. However, different books in the series adopt different genres –
including, for example, a James Bond-like spy thriller.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another place where genre and setting are at odds is in unusual,
one-shot role-playing games. For example, if you have an epic-fantasy
role-playing game à la D&amp;D, you usually play to save the world, get
rid of a tyrant, or cast out the darkness. In an unusual one-shot you
would play a different genre of story. As noted below, these scenarii
often require some alterations to the rules. (These necessary
alterations hint at the fact that the rule systems of role-playing games
are linked to both genre and setting.)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A heist: the heroes must use magic spells (or technological
gadgets for Science-Fiction settings) to stealthily infiltrate a high
security bank/hold/equivalent thereof, obtain a specific item,
exfiltrate the premises without being noticed.</p>
<p>In this genre, there is tension that escalates as the characters get
closer and closer to their objective, as they disarm each trap, avoid
each guard, unlock each door.</p>
<p>This type of scenario works best with a few changes to the mechanics
of the game. For example, if a character rolls poorly on an ability
check, they do not necessarily fail. Instead, they might succeed, but
take longer than expected which forces them to rush for the rest of
their mission. Or they might succeed, but accidentaly leave clues for
the guards to notice. Or even just be much noisier than they should
be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you open the lock, you fail to catch one of the chains that it
kept in place. <em>Cling</em>, <em>clang</em>, <em>clong</em>! It falls
on the floor and the sound echos in room. For a second, everyone is
silent.<br />
What do you do?</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>An investigation: the heroes must use their skills, tricks, and
equipment to solve a case. The only objective is to establish the
truth.</p>
<p>This is a somewhat more difficult story to adapt to role-playing
games because it relies on the players’ ability for deduction. This
means that the player – rather than the character – is doing the
detective work. It would render the whole thing very boring to ask
players to roll for deduction instead of letting them solve the mystery
at hand.</p>
<p>This means that the role-playing aspect of such a game shouldn’t
involve too much game mechanics. It cannot be played in all rule
systems.</p></li>
<li><p>A claustrophobic horror story: for some reason, the heroes are
trapped within a confined space that is inhabited by monsters and cut
off from the rest of the world. Their survival is at stake and they must
escape. Think Alien (1979) or even Alien: Isolation (2014).</p>
<p>Unlike usual role-playing game stories, the players are not in a
power fantasy. For this scenario to work, the characters must be in
actual danger with slim chances of survival. They should be greatly
out-numbered or over-powered by the monsters. The environment itself
should feel oppresive: short passages with bends and intersections that
limit their field of view, no precise map available, occasional hints of
the presence of monster(s) (sounds, shadows, left over partially eaten
bodies).</p>
<p>In this scenario, it is vital that the dungeon master makes it very
clear that head-first confrontation with the monster(s) is deadly and
that other courses of actions are available.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Unusual pairings of genre and setting can provide a refreshing break
in otherwise somewhat repetitive media (TV series, role-playing games):
they pit tropes against one another, they force the creators out of
their comfort zone, they extend the realm of possibilities.</p>
<p>But they also require some work from the creators involved. You
cannot simply use a rule system or an established story-telling device
used for a given genre/setting pair and use it on a different one.</p>
