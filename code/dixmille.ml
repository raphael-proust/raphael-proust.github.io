(* # Foreword: Dix-mille

   Dix-mille (Ten-thousands) is a dice game with risk/reward management. An
   interesting mechanics forces players to make choices not only about their own
   risk but also about the potential rewards for other players.

*)

(* # Introduction: dixmille.ml

   This file contains all the code necessary to play dix-mille. Typically, each
   individual module would be defined in their own separate file. However, the
   aim of this implementation of dix-mille is didactic. As such, it is intended
   to be read by a human more than it is intended to be compiled by a computer –
   although it is compilable by a computer.

   To ease reading, the different components of the implementation are placed in
   the same file. This gives a linear reading experience where the order is
   fixed as intended. This also frees the reader from having to set up a work
   environment that supports multi-files queries and such.

   This implementation walkthrough assumes the reader is familiar with basic
   coding, but assumes no advanced knowledge.

   With that in mind, here's a walkthrough of an implementation of dix-mille.

(* # Notations:

   In OCaml, comments, like this one, are delimited by bracket-asterisk (`(*`)
   and asterisk-bracket (`*)`).

   In this file, we use markdown in all comments: code is surrounded by
   backticks (like `so`) and emphasis is marked with asterisks (like *so* ).
   Unlike standard markdown, the indentation of text is meaningless: it merely
   follows the indentation of the code.

  end
end


(* # Part 1: Domain modeling

   Dix-mille is a dice game: during the course of the game, players roll
   (six-sided) dice. This first part of the implementation is intended to make
   it easy for the rest of the code to work with dice.

   This is called *domain modeling*, in which you create abstractions
   corresponding to the concepts that you handle in the program. If you make a
   dice game, the program handles (an abstraction of) dice, and if you make
   accounting software, the program handles monies, accounts, and balances.

   An important part of domain modeling in OCaml, and other similar languages,
   is to define *types*. The type system is a useful tool for the programmer. It
   takes some practice to use effectively, and practice often comes in the form
   of the compiler shouting at you, but it is worth the time spent.

*)

(* ## Aside: modules

   The implementation is separated into modules. The module language in OCaml is
   powerful, but we only use it for two reasons:

   - namespaces: Functions, values and types are defined inside a module so that
     the rest of the code refers to them under the module name. E.g., `D6.roll`
     rolls one six-sided die, but `D6s.roll` rolls multiple six-sided dice.
   - visibility: Some functions, values and types are defined within a module
     but are not exported in the module's signature. This limits their scope to
     the module itself, guaranteeing that code outside of the module cannot
     access them.

   Depending on specific intent, there are a few ways to introduce modules in
   OCaml. We use one form only:

   ```
   module Foo : sig
     <signature items are listed here>
   end = struct
     <implementation items are listed here>
   end
   ```

   The [OCaml manual](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/index.html)
   has examples (Chapters 1-6) and formal descriptions (Chapters 7 and 8) of all
   the syntactic constructs.

*)

module D6 : sig

  (* The type `t` is for values that represent a rolled, six-sided die.

     (From outside the module it is refered to as `D6.t` (as per the discussion
     on namespaces above), but inside the module (including in the comments
     within the module) it is simply refered to as `t`.)

     The type `t` is a sum type (also known as a variant type, akin to a union).
     In this case, a rolled dice can take one of the following six values:
     `One`, `Two`, `Three`, `Four`, `Five`, `Six`.

   *)
  type t =
    | One
    | Two
    | Three
    | Four
    | Five
    | Six

  (* Another possibility would be to represent a rolled die by an integer (with
     the built-in type `int`).

     However, for our purpose the sum type is more appropriate because `int`s do
     not have static guarantees about their range (i.e., `7` would be a valid
     rolled die as far as the type system is concerned). Thus, using the sum
     type helps us lean on the type system to guarantee that all our data is
     sound. Doing so, we offload some of the reasoning about our program to an
     automated system.

     Moreover, for our purpose, rolled die are not numbers: they are never
     added together nor compared. True, the face value of a die is a good
     mnemonic for the scoring system of the game of dix-mille, but dix-mille
     could be played with dice that have abstract symbols on their faces.

  *)

  (* `roll ()` returns a single, rolled six-sided die. *)
  val roll : unit -> t

     boilerplate code that is useful for showing the state of the game during
     interactive sessions, but it is not necessary to the game engine itself. *)

       the passed argument (exclusive). Hence, `Random.int 6` returns either of
       those six values: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`.

       This means the values are off-by-one: `0` is for `One` and so on. This
       happens in other parts of this implementation and is a very common
       occurrence in a lot of programs. *)

module D6s : sig

  (* The type `t` is for values representing a dice roll: a set of 6-sided dice
     that have been rolled.

     This is still part of the domain modeling. In fact, rolls of 6-sided dice
     are more important than an individual rolled 6-sided die for our purpose.
     The former is central to the game mechanics, the latter could be skipped
     although it would make some of the code later harder to read.

     Note that, in this here module's signature, the type `t` is *abstract*. It
     means that the definition of the type (its representation) is not exported
     to the other modules. As a result, code outside of this module can only
     work with values of the type `t` via the functions exported in this module.

     (The type definition is available locally in this module's implementation
     (see below) so functions of this module can still work with it.)

     Making a type abstract helps guarantee some invariants on the values of
     that type. Specifically, it ensures that local reasoning about the type is
     always correct: no code outside of this module can modify values in place,
     create new values, or otherwise break invariants.

       `roll 1 = make [D6.roll ()]` causes either of the left-hand side or
       right-hand side expression to be evaluated first, which changes the PRNG
       state, which causes the other expression to evaluate under a different

(* Part 2: points and counting them

   This section is still about building foundations for the game. It can still
   be considered domain modeling, although there are more advanced functions
   written here: it is not only about the basic primitives and abstractions but
   also about some of the peculiarities of this specific game rather than the
   domain of dice game in general.

*)


(* Counting points *)
module Points : sig

  (* Points, as accumulated by a player, are represented by an integer (of the
     type `int`). Note, however, that the integer is marked as `private`. This
     ensures that points cannot be constructed outside of this here module. Such
     a restriction is useful because of one of the peculiarity of the game:

     GAME RULE: if you go beyond the target score (10000), your score "bounces".
     E.g., if you have 9750 points, you are 250 points away from the target
     score. If, in this situation you score 400 points, then, out of the 400
     points you scored, 250 points are used to increase your score up to the
     target score (10000), and the remainder (400 - 250 = 150 points) decreases
     your score down from the target score. Your final score is the target score
     minus 150 points: 10000 - 150 = 9850 points.

     To minimise the number of possible bugs, it is better to implement such
     logic once and for all, and let all other parts of the code use the one
     reference implementation. This is enforced by the use of the private type:
     the other parts of the code can use the scores as ints, but they cannot
     construct the scores except by using the reference implementation, the
     function `add` provided in this here module.

  *)
  type t = private int

  (* `zero` is `0` as a `t` *)
  val zero : t

  (* `add t i` adds `i` points to `t`, it implements the game rule discussed
     above: the score bounces back from the target score. *)
  val add : t -> int -> t

  (* `target` is `10_000` as a `t`. Providing `target` as an explicit value
     (rather than letting other parts of the code write out the literal `10000`)
     has two advantages: (1) we can change the game to use a different target by
     changing one line of the code, and (2) we ensure that no typo introduces a
     bug. *)
  val target : t

end = struct

  (* Locally, the type `t` is not private and is manipulated like an int. *)

    if sum <= target then
      sum
    else

      target - (sum - target)

end


(* The `Scoring` module implements the counting of points yielded by a dice
   roll. Different dice roll offer different choices to the player.

   The names in this module are more abstract. This is because the game is
   normally taught by showing (rather than naming) things. As a result,
   different players use different names for the same concepts depending on who
   taught them the game. Some rules are also expressed in a hand-wavy langauge
   that computers do not understand.

*)
module Scoring : sig

  (* An `atom` is a multiset of dice that scores a given number of points
     according to the rules. E.g., `[Six; Six; Six]` (a set of three six-sided
     dice that all rolled `Six`) is worth `600` points.

     An `atom` is represented by a `D6s.t`. (Or more technically, “a value of
     the type `atom` is represented by a value of the type `D6s.t`.”)

     The private restriction means that values of the type `atom` cannot be
     constructed outside of this module. This strikes a middle ground between
     - a concrete type (which can be constructed and destructed (meaning
       observed in some details) by any part of the code) and
     - an abstract type (which can only be constructed and destructed by parts
       of the code that have access to the definition).
     With a private type, the values can only be constructed by parts of the
     code that have access to the unrestricted definition (inside the module)
     but it can be destructed (e.g., it can be converted to `D6s.t` for free)

  (* A player can make three kinds of choices:
     - choose which dice to **pick** out of a roll,
     - choose whether to **bank** the current running points or continue
       rolling,
     - choose whether to **keep** the **run** of the previous player's or start
       afresh.

     Thus, a strategy is a set of three functions, one for each of these
     choices.

     Note that the type of `t` here is parametrised by `'game`. The parameter is
     intended to be given the `Game.t` type. However, because that type is
     defined later (see below in the `Game` module), we cannot use it here.

     In a way, the type `t` and the type `Game.t` are mutually recursive (i.e.,
     the type of strategies depends on the type of games, and vice versa as seen
     below). There are multiple ways to break that mutual dependency, here we
     parameterise the earlier type by the later type. As a consequence, it is
     not possible to instantiate the deisred strategies yet, this is done later
     (see module `Strategies` once the module `Game` is defined.
  *)
  type 'game t = {
    pick: (game:'game -> choices:Scoring.t list -> Scoring.t);
    bank: (game:'game -> bool);
    keep_run: (game:'game -> bool);
  }

end = struct

  type 'game t = {
    pick: (game:'game -> choices:Scoring.t list -> Scoring.t);
    bank: (game:'game -> bool);
    keep_run: (game:'game -> bool);
  }

end


(* A `Player` is a participant in the game. *)
module rec Player : sig

  (* The type `Player.t` is for the values that the game engine uses to
     represent players. Players are defined by an identifier (this is not
     strictly necessary but it is useful to determine which player actually
     won), a count of points that have already been banked, and a strategy
     (i.e., a decision making process).

     Note that `Player.t`s have a `Strategy.t` which means that they
     (transitively) depend on the type `Game.t`. As a result, the type
     `Player.t` is mutually recursive with the type `Game.t`. Unlike with
     `Strategy.t` we do not break this mutual recursion with a type parameter.
     Instead, we make the modules `Player` and `Game` mutually recursive. Note
     how the modules are declared:

     ```
     module rec Player : sig … end = struct … end
     and Game : sig … end = struct … end

     player.

     More specifically, `bank p points` is a value of type `Player.t` that is
     identical to `p` except that the count of banked points is increased by
     `points`. This means that values of the type `Player.t` do not actually
     change: instead, new values with different counts of point are created. *)
