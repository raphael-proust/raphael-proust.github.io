<h1 class="title">Vi as a programming language</h1>
</div>
<p>Disclaimer: this is not a vi-vs-emacs post. The comments of this post
may apply to emacs as well – let me know if they do or don’t. It just so
happens that I use vi, and thus can comment on it, but have only been
exposed to emacs for a few hours, and thus cannot make any serious
comment on it.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: this post does not claim that vi (and other editors which
are programming languages) are better than editors which are not
programming languages.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: “vi” here stands for the whole family of editors: vi,
vim, neovim, elvis, nvi, vis, etc. Although some specific examples are
from one clone or another, the core ideas of the post are about the
whole family of clones.</p>
<h2 id="vi-has-and-is-a-programming-language">Vi has <em>and is</em> a
programming language</h2>
<p>Most vi clones embed one or more scripting languages. This lets the
user customise what their own instance of their favourite clone of vi is
capable of: managing Git repositories, manipulating dates and
timestamps, handling pairs of quotes, parentheses and other directional
typographic markers, tampering with constructs from one programming
language or another.</p>
<p>But, more importantly, vi is a programming language.</p>
<h3 id="state-and-actions-hand-wavy-semantics">State and actions:
hand-wavy semantics</h3>
<p>The state handled by vi programs is primarily composed of the text
and the cursor position. (Other elements such as modes and registers are
discussed later.) A smaller-step semantics can also take into account
pending operators, but it is beyond the scope of this post.</p>
<p>Vi programs modify that state in different ways.</p>
<p>First, programs can modify the cursor position. This is achieved with
movement operators: <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>,
<code>l</code>, <code>w</code>, <code>e</code>, <code>{</code>,
<code>}</code>, etc. There are also movement functions. These take an
argument which parametrise the movement on the state: <code>f</code>,
<code>t</code>, etc..</p>
<p>Second, programs can modify the text in different ways. Some
modifications are immediate: <code>x</code>, <code>~</code>,
<code>D</code>, <code>J</code>. Other modifications take an argument:
<code>r</code>.</p>
<p>More importantly, the two concepts (movement and text modifications)
are often mixed. Many modification operators are defined in relation
with movement operators. These modify all the text between the current
cursor position and the cursor position after the movement. E.g.,
<code>d</code>, <code>c</code>.</p>
<p>Third, almost all operators (be it for movement or text
modification), can be executed multiple time – like the body of a
for-loop. This is done by prefixing operators with numbers.</p>
<h3 id="hand-wavy-grammar">Hand-wavy grammar</h3>
<p>The operations described above combine in ways described by the
following grammar.</p>
<pre><code>SimpleModifier ::= ZeroaryModifier            // e.g., x
                 | UnaryModifier Character    // e.g., r
                 | CompositeModifier Mover    // e.g., d
Modifier       ::= SimpleModifier
                 | Number SimpleModifier
SimpleMover    ::= ZeroaryMover               // e.g., j
                 | UnaryMover Character       // e.g., f
Mover          ::= SimpleMover
                 | Number SimpleMover</code></pre>
<p>Note that this hand-wavy grammar is heavily simplified. Notably,
explicit ranges (also known as text objects) can describe a part of the
text that does not start or end at the current character. For example
<code>aw</code> is a movement-like construct in that it can be used with
a composite modifier to apply to <strong>a</strong>
<strong>w</strong>ord. However, <code>aw</code> is not a movement
construct by itself: it cannot be used outside of a composite
modifier.</p>
<p>Another simplification is that some movers operate line-wise. When
they are used with a composite modifier, the modification applies to
whole lines: from the one on which the cursor currently is to the one
the cursor lands after the move.</p>
<h3 id="insert-mode">Insert mode</h3>
<p>Another simplification is the omission of modes. A full semantic of
vi is complex and has to consider many of the corner cases and
exceptions. A simplified version of the insert mode can be described as
a n-ary modifier.</p>
<p>In this simplified view, <code>i</code> (and other operators that
switch to insert mode) takes any number of characters and modifies the
text by adding the given characters.</p>
<p>This simplified view differs from vi because it is possible to do
more than just add characters in insert mode. For example, backspace can
be used in insert mode to erase characters.</p>
<h3 id="meta-programming-for-everyone">Meta-programming for
everyone</h3>
<p>Interestingly, vi is used to edit source code. In other words, vi is
a programming language used to generate source code which is in turn
compiled into programs. To some extent, vi can be seen as a metalanguage
that supports a range of object languages: you write vi commands which
produce OCaml/C/Python code that executes.</p>
<h2 id="criticisms">Criticisms</h2>
<p>There is a case to be made that vi is not a programming language.
That vi’s UI merely borrows some ideas from programming languages.</p>
<p>The main criticism along this line goes something like this: if vi is
a programming language, where are the conditionals?</p>
<p>First, there are explicit conditionals in Ex commands
(<code>:g</code> and <code>:v</code>).</p>
<p>Second, when movement operators fail to move the cursor (e.g.,
<code>f</code> where the argument character cannot be found), the
modification operator it is combined with has no effect.</p>
<p>But more importantly, third, vi is a domain specific programming
language intended primarily for interactive use. That is, vi is meant to
be used with the text displayed for the user (programmer) to see – hence
the name <code>vi</code> derived from <em>visual</em>. Criticising the
lack of conditionals in vi’s normal mode is like criticising the lack of
type checking in Makefiles: it is out of scope.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-with-other-editors">Comparison with other
editors</h2>
<p>Other editors also have operators to modify the text and cursor
position. For example, in <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, all the
normal keys are used to insert the corresponding character into the
text. Some control keys (e.g., backspace, delete) are used to modify the
text in other ways. Some other control characters are used to change the
cursor position. And finally, modifier keys (control, alt) chords are
used to modify the text in programmable ways by calling into a scripting
language (Javascript).</p>
<p>Many editors fit the same description and only require minor
variations: which scripting language they use, which control keys do
what, etc.</p>
<p>IDEs also fall under this category of editors. They only happen to
have many functionalities bound to various modifier key chords. These
functionalities are often specialised to a specific type of file –
typically, source code of a given programming language.</p>
<p>How is this different from vi? How does this difference supports the
claim that vi is a programming language?</p>
<p>Vi operators combine together to form syntactical constructs. In
other words, vi has a grammar (see above).</p>
<p>Vi text modifiers and cursor movers are orthogonal: they combine in
predictable ways, but they can evolve independently.</p>
<p>In vi, some sequences of instructions are equivalent to others (e.g.,
<code>2dd</code> and <code>dj</code>). These equivalences are often
non-trivial and sometimes depend on context. These non-trivial
equivalences give rise to <a href="http://www.vimgolf.com/">vimgolf</a>,
which is a specific version of code golf.</p>
<p>These are descriptions of programming languages.</p>
