<h1 class="title">Keyboard mapping</h1>
</div>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. I started using Vim when
I decided to study computer science at university. I borrowed a book
from the University library (something about Unix) and there was this
whole thing about <code>vi</code> and modes and the terminal. It was a
gruelling experience. I only ever recommend Vim to people that spend
hours a day coding or otherwise editing markup or plain-text.</p>
<p>I also use Vimperator (Vim-like interface to Firefox) and many other
programs that share some keybindings with Vim. The most commonly shared
keys are the “arrows”: h, j, k, l.</p>
<p>What with all this use of h, j, k, l, I started shifting the resting
position of my hands on my keyboard. Specifically, I moved my right-hand
one letter to the left; my home keys became asdf-hjkl. This was annoying
though because important keys such as backslash and enter become less
accessible.</p>
<p>So I decided to remap my keyboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>j becomes h,</li>
<li>k becomes j,</li>
<li>l becomes k,</li>
<li>semicolon becomes l, and to close the loop</li>
<li>h becomes semicolon</li>
</ul>
<p>With this, the home-keys (physical keys jkl-semicolon) are the same
as the Vim movement keys (hjkl). One last tweak was to swap the shift
behaviour of semicolon. So in fact: h becomes colon and shift+h becomes
semicolon. This is only worth it because I generally use a programming
language with few semicolons: <a href="http://ocaml.org/">Ocaml</a>.</p>
<p>To implement this, I have a modified <code>xkb</code> file to include
the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>key &lt;AC05&gt; {
    type= &quot;ALPHABETIC&quot;,
    symbols[Group1]= [          g,         G ]
};
key &lt;AC06&gt; {         [      colon, semicolon ] };
key &lt;AC07&gt; {
    type= &quot;ALPHABETIC&quot;,
    symbols[Group1]= [          h,         H ]
};
key &lt;AC08&gt; {
    type= &quot;ALPHABETIC&quot;,
    symbols[Group1]= [          j,         J ]
};
key &lt;AC09&gt; {
    type= &quot;ALPHABETIC&quot;,
    symbols[Group1]= [          k,         K ]
};
key &lt;AC10&gt; {
    type= &quot;ALPHABETIC&quot;,
    symbols[Group1]= [          l,         L ]
};
key &lt;AC11&gt; {         [ apostrophe,  quotedbl ] };</code></pre>
<p>and my <code>.xinitrc</code> executes
<code>xkbcomp $HOME/.xkb.hjkl $DISPLAY</code>.</p>
<p>In addition, to make it work outside of X11, I have a
<code>/etc/vconsole.conf</code> which contains the line
<code>KEYMAP="hjklus"</code>. This points to the file
<code>/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/hjklus.map.gz</code> which is a
modified version of
<code>/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/us.map.gz</code>.</p>
<p>You can find all the files in my <a
href="https://github.com/raphael-proust/rcs">configuration
repository</a>.</p>
