<blockquote>
<p>Because discussions about code readability often slides into
arguments about some subjective sense of æsthetics</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coding is writing source code. Much like writing prose, writing
source code is about communicating. You communicate most often to fellow
humans (colleagues, contributors, maintainers, reviewers) and
occasionally to computers (compilers, language servers, linters).
Because fellow humans have limited attention span, cognitive bandwidth,
and patience, you should make reading easy.</p>
<p>(Arguably, a program may be compiled more often than it is read.
However, whether you compile your program once or a thousand times, the
same communication is repeated. And so, for our purpose, multiple
communications with the compiler count as one.)</p>
<p>(Below, I focus on communication between the programmer and a
singular reviewer. This is merely to make the examples simpler and
clearer. Nonetheless, the advice should help you just as much to write
readable code for other people.)</p>
<p>Another way in which writing code is similar to writing prose: there
is a plethora of style guides telling you what to do. Very few of those
style guides ever explain why you should follow their advice, just that
you should.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>The Sense of Style</em> (Steven Pinker, ISBN 9780670025855) is a
style guide for writing prose, with a focus on clear non-fiction prose.
The book stands out amongst style guides for multiple reasons, including
that it explains its advice. That is, the style guide tells you why a
particular piece of advice makes sense and in which contexts it makes
sense. It gives a sense of purpose to the advice and helps you determine
the extent to which you should apply it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some time ago, I reviewed some code. I noticed a function that looked
like this:</p>
<pre><code>let dir =
    match dir_from_config () with
    | Some p -&gt; p
    | None -&gt; match dir_from_cli_arg () with
        | None -&gt; def_dir
        | Some p -&gt; p</code></pre>
<p>And a little bit further something along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>List.iter
    (fun (formatter, channel) -&gt;
        setup_formatter formatter
            (if is_a_tty channel then Ansi else Plain))
    [ (Format.std_formatter, Unix.stdout) ;
        (Format.err_formatter, Unix.stderr) ]</code></pre>
<p>Both of these fragments are correct: they do what they are supposed
to. In other words, with both of these fragments, the programmer
communicates successfully with the compiler. However, the communication
with a reviewer (me) fell short. And so I wanted to suggest
alternatives.</p>
<p>Importantly, I wanted to explain what made the alternatives more
readable. This is important because discussions about code, especially
code readability, often slides into unfounded arguments about some
subjective sense of æsthetics.</p>
<p>Explaining what made the alternatives more readable, I ended up
paraphrasing Pinker’s The Sense of Style. And that got me
thinking:<br />
How much of the advice in The Sense of Style can be applied to code?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-sense-of-coding-style">The Sense of Coding Style</h2>
<p>Below is collected advice from The Sense of Style, adapted to writing
source code. I also recommend reading the original: it is indirectly
applicable to writing code (as shown below) and directly applicable to
writing documentation and tutorials.</p>
<h3 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h3>
<p>A few things that need to be said beforehand.</p>
<h4 id="what-this-is-not">What this is not</h4>
<p>This is not a tutorial. You cannot learn to code by reading this
page.</p>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list of dos and donts about the minutia of
styling. Instead, this is a collection of pieces of general advice on
writing more readable code, each with an explanation of why the advice
is helpful. As such, it stands somewhere between concrete advice about
readability and non-specific discourse about what even is
readability.</p>
<p>This is not a list of pieces of advice that you can all apply in all
situations. You will need to understand why each piece of advice makes
sense and, in many cases, you will need to decide which piece of advice
to prioritise.</p>
<p>Note that all the code examples are given in OCaml. However, the
advice is more general: it can be applied to programs written in other
languages.</p>
<h4 id="why-this-is-important">Why this is important</h4>
<p>Writing readable code is important for multiple reasons. First, it
eases the life of the reviewer of your software. Making someone else’s
life easy is nice.<br />
Be nice.</p>
<p>Second, writing readable code helps avoid bugs. This is a take on
Hoare’s famous quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious
deficiencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst Hoare makes the distinction between simple and complicated
code, the same distinction between readable and obscure code is just as
valid.<br />
Just like simplicity, readability is a mean to an end: correctness.</p>
<h3 id="boilerplate-advice">Boilerplate advice</h3>
<p>Advice surrounding a software project.</p>
<h4 id="avoid-metadiscourse">Avoid metadiscourse</h4>
<p>Metadiscourse is when you write about the structure of the writing
(e.g., “Sections 1, 2 and 3 cover … and Sections 4 and 5 cover …”) or
about the process of writing (e.g., “We started by researching … for
which we attempted to interview … but we were unable to because …”).</p>
<p>A programming equivalent to metadiscourse is the comment that plainly
describe the code.</p>
<pre><code>(* Sort the elements and remove duplicates *)
List.sort xs |&gt; List.deduplicate</code></pre>
<p>Another is historical anecdotes about development.</p>
<pre><code>(* This function used to be exposed in the public
   interface. Now it is hidden because … *)</code></pre>
<p>Note that in this second example, a comment may be necessary.
However, the comment should focus on the code as it is
(<code>This function is hidden because …</code>) and not on the trivia
of development history (<code>This function used to…</code>).</p>
<p>Metadiscourse most often unnecessarily captures some of the limited
attention of the reviewer. Avoid it.</p>
<h4 id="build-narratives">Build narratives</h4>
<p>In a project, arrange code in an order that the reader can follow. It
can be general-to-specific, or big-to-small, or network-to-disk, or
high-level-to-low-level, or user-inputs-to-screen-updates, or
database-to-webpage. The important thing is that the reader is able to
latch onto a narrative in order to ease the reading.</p>
<p>One way to achieve this is to include a reading guide for the whole
project in your README or for a specific component in a relevant
file(s). Simply add a short section explaining how that module there
grabs the keyboard and translates the keycodes, then that other module
there parses the keycodes into actions, etc.</p>
<p>Another way that the code can be thought of as a narrative is to lean
on the type of narratives that your programming language supports. In
imperative languages such as C, procedure names should be active verbs
because they act on the parameters. In declarative languages such as
Haskell, function names should be nouns or past-tense verbs because they
create new values that relate to parameters in a certain way. Compare
<code>subtract(accumulator, delta)</code> (“actively subtract
<code>delta</code> from the <code>accumulator</code>”) to
<code>difference old_v new_v</code> (“this expression evaluates to the
difference between <code>old_v</code> and <code>new_v</code>”).</p>
<p>In languages that support multiple styles of programming, use
different kinds of names for different kinds of functions. Compare
Python’s <code>someList.sort()</code> and
<code>sorted(someList)</code>.</p>
<h4 id="balance">Balance</h4>
<p>All the advice given on this page (above and below) should be applied
only to the extent that it makes code more readable. Never apply the
advice blindly, ask yourself: what does this piece of advice achieve
with my code?</p>
<p>Not sure about a specific case? Ask a colleague’s opinion.</p>
<p>Ask for feedback.<br />
Ask for reviews.<br />
Ask for advice.</p>
<h3 id="identifiers">Identifiers</h3>
<p>Naming things is hard.</p>
<h4 id="names">Names</h4>
<p>Whilst many style guides insist on using long descriptive names for
all variables, there are situations where short names are
preferable.</p>
<p>One such situation is with very abstract variables. For example, in a
library implementing a collection, be it a list or an array or a tree,
the elements of the collection are abstract. Because they are abstract,
long descriptive names are very generic and abstract themselves:
‘element’, ‘item’, ‘member’, or some such. In this case, the long name
does not carry more information than a single-letter name:
<code>e</code>, <code>x</code>, <code>v</code>, or some such.</p>
<p>You can also introduce the naming conventions of your module.</p>
<pre><code>(* In this library, the following names are used:
   [e], [x], [y], [z]: elements held in a collection
   [c], [xs], [ys], [zs]: collections
   [acc]: accumulators when traversing a collection
*)</code></pre>
<p>Another situation where short names are good is for very local
variables. When a variable is only in scope for a few lines, the
reviewer does not need to commit the variable to a long-lived context.
In this case, a short name is sufficient: quickly parsed, quickly
forgotten. The shortness of the name signals to the reviewer that the
variable is short-lived. For example:</p>
<pre><code>match … with
| Ok v -&gt; Some v
| Error errors -&gt;
    iter errors
        (fun error -&gt;
            log_error error;
            if is_fatal error then exit 1);
    None</code></pre>
<p>Because <code>v</code> is simply converted from a positive
<code>result</code> to a positive <code>option</code>, there is no need
to dwell on it. Sure, <code>successful_result</code> would be more
descriptive, but it would need to be forgotten just as soon. On the
other hand, <code>errors</code> deserves more attention because its
scope is longer and because it is more consequential. Thus,
<code>errors</code> is given a more descriptive name.</p>
<h4 id="the-curse-of-knowledge">The curse of knowledge</h4>
<p>When you write code, you over-estimate your reader’s familiarity with
both the code and its context. When you over-estimate your reader you
write more obscure code.</p>
<p>Always consider that your reader is intelligent but unfamiliar with
the libraries you are using, the concurrent processes that may be
executing, the concurrency model of your scheduler, or any other such
minute context.</p>
<p><strong>Abbreviations</strong>:</p>
<p>To avoid relying on the familiarity of your reviewer, make
abbreviations scarce. And for abbreviations you do use, consider
introducing them at the beginning of the module.</p>
<pre><code>(* In this module, some variable names are
   reserved for the following uses
   [st]: variable carrying state as defined
         in {!State}
   [cfg]: variable carrying configuration as
          defined in {!Configuration}, the
          variables [cfg_env], and [cfg_cli]
          are inferred from the environment
          and the command line arguments
          respectively.
*)</code></pre>
<p>Make abbreviations in interfaces even scarcer: Even if you use
<code>st</code> as a variable name in the implementation, the module
that packs multiple functions handling such values should be spelled out
<code>State</code>. This is because the interface is used to communicate
with a larger set of people – including other programmers working on
separate projects using your library as a dependency.</p>
<p><strong>Abstractions</strong>:</p>
<p>Over-estimating your reader, you might refer to abstractions by their
technical academic names. You might be satisfied with documenting a
whole module with a blurb along the lines of “implements a <em>state
monad</em> specialised to handling contexts” or a class with “a
<em>factory</em> for cooperative threadlets schedulers”.</p>
<p>Using abstractions and defining your own abstractions is important.
In fact, it is arguably what programming/computer science is. But
readers might not know all the abstractions used in your code, nor the
nomenclature surrounding them. Explain abstractions, give examples.</p>
<p><strong>Functional fixity</strong>:</p>
<p>The more you know how to use a thing, the less you see other ways to
use it. For example, you might start to see a monad as just that: an
abstract way to thread data of a specific type through a computation.
But even when you provide a monad library, you should still consider
giving a variant of your operators that is more grounded, that reflects
more what the function does rather than how it is meant to be used.</p>
<p>Compare the following two chunks.</p>
<pre><code>(** monadic bind for the list monad *)
val bind: &#39;a list -&gt; (&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b list) -&gt; &#39;b list
val ( &gt;&gt;= ): &#39;a list -&gt; (&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b list) -&gt; &#39;b list</code></pre>
<pre><code>(** [flat_map xs f] is equivalent to (but more efficient
    than) [flatten (map f xs)]. In other words,
    [flat_map [x1; x2; ..] f] is equivalent to
    [f x1 @ f x2 @ ..]. *)
val flat_map: &#39;a list -&gt; (&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b list) -&gt; &#39;b list
(** [bind] and [&gt;&gt;=] are aliases for [flat_map]. They are
    provided for use as monad operators for the list monad. *)
val bind: &#39;a list -&gt; (&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b list) -&gt; &#39;b list
val ( &gt;&gt;= ): &#39;a list -&gt; (&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b list) -&gt; &#39;b list</code></pre>
<p>This helps in multiple ways. First, for the reviewer, who might not
be familiar with the specific monad they are reviewing, it splits the
work into two easier tasks: verify that the function’s implementation is
correct (i.e., that its behaviour matches its name and documentation)
and verify that the function combines with others according to the
monadic laws. By merely exporting a more explicitly named function
alongside the abstractly named function, you prepare this two-step work
for the reviewer.</p>
<p>Second, it helps users of your library to use your provided function
in a non-monadic setting.</p>
<p>This advice applies equally to abstractions other than a monad.</p>
<h3 id="grammars">Grammars</h3>
<p>Advice about trees.</p>
<h4 id="the-graph-the-tree-and-the-string">The graph, the tree, and the
string</h4>
<p>The Sense of Style goes to great lengths to explain how grammar is a
way to encode parts of a graph of ideas into a string of words.
Specifically, grammar allows a speaker/writer to represent a few ideas
and the links between them (a graph) as a tree of grammatical constructs
and then that tree as a string of words. In other words, grammar is a
serialiser.</p>
<p>Grammar is also a set of rules for retrieving the serialised graph of
ideas from the string representation. Specifically, grammar allows a
listener/reader to recover, from a string of words, a tree of
grammatical constructs, and then, from that tree, the ideas and links it
represents. In other words, grammar is also a parser.</p>
<p>For example “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” is a
serialisation of an idea that a certain animal with a certain coat and a
certain aptitude performs a specific action in a specific location
relative to another animal with a certain character flaw. The same idea
can be serialised differently as “over the dog that is lazy, the fox
that is fast and brown jumps” or other such variation. A human that
understands English understands how to deserialise either of the
sentences to recover the meaning.</p>
<p>As far as this encoding/decoding goes, programmers and reviewers
enjoy several advantage over the writers and readers of prose.</p>
<p>One advantage of programming languages is that the rules of parsing
are formalised. As a result, there are no ambiguous strings that may be
interpreted as two distinct trees. Or if there are, then it’s neither
the writer’s nor the reader’s fault: it’s the compiler’s.</p>
<p>Another advantage of programming languages is that programmers have
much more freedom in the serialising. For example, in most programming
languages, programmers can add extraneous parentheses and break line
freely. Even if these syntactic options are not available, then a
programmer can associate additional names to a value or break a function
in multiple parts.</p>
<p>Finally, a big advantage of programming languages is that the tree
has more importance than in prose. Reviewers have explicit knowledge of
what the tree is; the tree even bears a name: the abstract syntax tree
(AST). Reviewers attempt to first recover the tree, and then the process
it describes.</p>
<p>These are two things programmers can help reviewers with: recovering
the tree and inferring what process it describes.</p>
<h4 id="from-the-pixels-on-a-screen-to-the-ast">From the pixels on a
screen to the AST</h4>
<p>A reviewer starts by parsing your code to build a mental
representation of the abstract syntax tree. The first step a reviewer
takes is parsing your code: reading the visual representation of a
stream of bytes on the screen, and building an AST from that visual
representation.</p>
<p>A good exploration of this topic is available in the paper <a
href="https://hal.inria.fr/file/index/docid/737414/filename/langViz-popl-submitted.pdf">“A
visual perception account of programming languages: finding the natural
science in the art” (by Stéphane Conversy)</a>.</p>
<p>The paper explains how a reader reads code, what visual processes it
involves, etc. It also explains how certain editor features (such as
syntax colouring) or writing conventions (such as indentation) can be
helpful to the reader. All in all, this paper gives a good framework for
talking about the pixels-to-AST conversion.</p>
<p><strong>Indentation</strong>:</p>
<p>One way that the programmer can help the reviewer is to match the
visual representation to the AST. For example, indenting the code gives
an easy way for the reviewer to asses the general shape of the AST. The
number of blank pixels on the left-hand-side of each line gives an
indication of the shape of the program.</p>
<p>However, matching the indentation to the AST depths only addresses
half of the indentation issue. The other half of the issue is to shape
the AST correctly. Shaping the AST correctly makes for a simpler
indentation pattern (as shown in the example below). Additional (non
indentation-related) advantages of shaping the AST correctly are
explored later.</p>
<p>In general, flat or end-heavy trees are easier to read because they
minimise the distances that separate related things. Consider the three
examples below which have equivalent but distinct ASTs.</p>
<p>As a beginning-heavy tree, finding the error-printing that matches
the error condition requires scanning through many empty lines.</p>
<pre><code>if time &lt; now then
    if not (is_full buffer) then
        if valid_entry input then
            if is_unknown_entry input then
                insert_new_entry input
            else
                update_entry input
        else
            print_error &quot;Input is invalid&quot;
    else
        print_error &quot;Buffer is full, cannot process&quot;
else
    print_error &quot;Update is in the future&quot;</code></pre>
<p>As a mixed-heavy tree, it is not immediately clear what are error
conditions versus valid conditions, nor where the branches lead to.</p>
<pre><code>if time &lt; now then
    if is_full buffer then
        print_error &quot;Buffer is full, cannot process&quot;
    else if valid_entry input then
        if is_unknown_entry input then
            insert_new_entry input
        else
            update_entry input
    else
        print_error &quot;Input is invalid&quot;
else
    print_error &quot;Update is in the future&quot;</code></pre>
<p>As a end-heavy tree, each error message follows immediately its error
condition and the control-flow is immediately obvious.</p>
<pre><code>if now &lt;= time then
    print_error &quot;Update is in the future&quot;
else if is_full buffer then
    print_error &quot;Buffer is full, cannot process&quot;
else if not (valid_entry input) then
    print_error &quot;Input is invalid&quot;
else if is_unknown_entry input then
    insert_new_entry input
else
    update_entry input</code></pre>
<p>Note that in many cases, end-heavy trees can be indented as flat
trees. This last example is one such case. Sequences of binding are
another.</p>
<p><strong>Syntactical parallelism</strong>:</p>
<p>When two functions do similar things, they should have similar names.
When two variables hold similar values, they should have similar
names.</p>
<p>For example, avoid mixing snake and camel case in a single project –
or, if you do, do so to highlight fundamental differences between two
kinds of values. But also avoid having a
<code>filter_elements_out_of_list</code> (active verb) along with a
<code>collection_filter</code> (noun-phrase): if the two have the same
effect, their naming should follow similar conventions.</p>
<p>In general, when things are alike, their textual representation
should be similar. This is the syntactical pendant to structural
parallelism (see below for details).</p>
<h4 id="from-the-ast-to-groking-the-code">From the AST to groking the
code</h4>
<p>After parsing the AST in their head, a reviewer then tries to
understand what the AST means:<br />
How does control flow from one place to another?<br />
How does data flow from one place to another?<br />
How does a given part of the tree transforms a given piece of
data?<br />
How does an error propagates through the tree?</p>
<p>Whilst building an understanding of the program, the reviewer needs
to maintain a working memory of the context of the code they are
reviewing. For example, when reading a line, they need to have an idea
of what variables are in scope and what their values represent, under
what conditions can the program reach that line, etc. To ease the
review, programmers can shape their trees in a way that reduces
cognitive workload for the reviewers.</p>
<p><strong>The depth and width of trees</strong>:</p>
<p>In order to reduce the cognitive workload of reviewers, prefer
flat-and-wide trees to deep-and-narrow trees. This is because, in
general, the conditions necessary to reach a deep node of the AST are
more intricate.</p>
<p>(Remember that, as explained above, end-heavy trees are similar to
flat-and-wide trees.)</p>
<p>Look back at the indentation examples above and notice how the
end-heavy tree is easier to parse. In particular, consider what
information you need to keep in mind when reviewing this tree. The
conditions necessary to reach a given line is a conjunction of simple
boolean expressions that appear above it. That conjunction grows
regularly as you read more and more lines.</p>
<p>Conversely, the beginning-heavy version requires more effort. Whether
you take a line-by-line approach (in which you must first build up a
conjunction of expressions, and then unwind it carefully one after the
other in LIFO order) or a condition-by-condition approach (in which you
read a condition and immediately move your attention to the
<code>else</code>-branch before coming back to the
<code>then</code>-branch), you need to keep more context in mind.</p>
<p><strong>The order of branches</strong>:</p>
<p>If you do have to include some deep trees, then prefer
<strong>end-heavy</strong> trees. The heaviness being at the end means
that the reviewer can understand the beginning part, commit that
understanding to memory, and then move on to understand the rest. By
contrast, a tree that is middle-heavy requires a lot of stack unwinding
from the reviewer.</p>
<p>Refer back to the indentation examples above and work through how
your focus has to move through the text whilst you attempt to understand
them.</p>
<p>For the same reason, if you find yourself with a branch that requires
a comment (because it is too hard to understand without it), then this
branch should be placed at the end.</p>
<p>Another way to order branches is <strong>given-before-new</strong>
(a.k.a. <strong>known-before-unknown</strong>): finish processing
related data before processing the next bit. In the example below, note
how the order of the branches places the processing
(<code>process_with_…</code>) near the respective queries
(<code>find_…</code>).</p>
<pre><code>match find_metadata_date picture with
| Some date -&gt; process_with_metadata_date picture date
| None -&gt; match find_file_creation_date picture with
    | Some date -&gt; process_with_file_date picture date
    | None -&gt; fail &quot;cannot find date for picture&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Another factor to consider when ordering branches is
<strong>normal-before-exception</strong>. In general, inputs can be
categorised into two: valid and expected inputs, and invalid or
unexpected inputs. Thinking about invalid/unexpected inputs has a
greater cognitive load because it requires having to think about corner
cases, unusual conditions, etc.</p>
<p>How to reconcile these rules? When you have a simple exception
handling and a complex normal case, do you put the normal (complex)
branch first or the simple (exception) branch first? You can try both
and assess for yourself or ask a colleague to help. You can also move
part of the processing into a separate function with a descriptive
name.</p>
<pre><code>let retreive_information key =
    let connection = connect_to_server config.server in
    let request = get connection key in
    let raw_result = wait request in
    let result = parse_raw_information raw_result in
    result

let retreive_information key =
    try retreive_information key
    with e -&gt; log e; exit 1</code></pre>
<p>More generally, you can use the abstractions available in the
programming language –or even introduce your own– so as to order your
branches in a way that follows the different pieces of advice above.</p>
<p>Consider an error monad. Specifically, consider the program below and
how the error monad pushes the exception-handling code at the end. This
helps the reviewer to temporarily tune-down error management: first
review the chain of calls (<code>open_file</code>,
<code>read_content</code>, <code>split_into_lines</code>), and only
later review the handling of errors.</p>
<pre><code>let ( &gt;&gt;= ) v f = match v with
    | Ok ok -&gt; f ok
    | Error error -&gt; Error error

let catch_all f v =
    try Ok (f v) with e -&gt; Error e

let lines_of_file file =
    match
        catch_all open_file file &gt;&gt;= fun handle -&gt;
        catch_all read_content handle &gt;&gt;= fun content -&gt;
        Ok (split_into_lines content)
    with
    | Ok lines -&gt; lines
    | Error exc -&gt; log_exception exc; exit 1</code></pre>
<p><strong>Structural parallelism</strong>:</p>
<p>When two functions do similar things, their AST should be shaped
similarly. When two variables hold similar values, the AST of the
expressions that initialises them should be shaped similarly.</p>
<p>In many cases, avoiding repetitions is easy: two functions that do
similar things can often be made into a single function that accepts an
additional parameter. Even when factoring the two functions into one is
not possible, parts of them can sometimes still be factored out into a
third function. Because of the relative ease with which programmers can
avoid repetition, they tend to try to always avoid repetition.</p>
<p>However, repetition is fine – especially when it simplifies the
code.</p>
<p>For example, consider some limitation of a programming language that
prevents the factoring out of two functions. Let’s say that we cannot
use any fancy features due to backwards compatibility with early
versions of the language or compatibility with some other compiler.
Let’s say, specifically, that we need to duplicate a function to work on
two different kinds of collections: lists and arrays.</p>
<pre><code>let summarize_list l =
    let sum = List.fold_left (+) 0 l in
    let len = List.length l in
    if len &gt; threshold_length then
        skewed_average (List.nth l 0) sum len
    else
        sum / len</code></pre>
<p>The array counterpart to this list function should look very similar.
It should, as much as possible, be a simple substitution of module
identifiers.</p>
<pre><code>let summarize_array a =
    let sum = Array.fold_left (+) 0 a in
    let len = Array.length a in
    if len &gt; threshold_length then
        skewed_average a.(0) sum len
    else
        sum / len</code></pre>
<p>The similarity in the structure of the function’s tree point to the
similarities in the meaning of the function. Understanding the second
version becomes a simple game of “spot the difference”. And a reviewer
can easily cheat at such a game using tools such as
<code>diff</code>.</p>
<h4 id="use-positives">Use positives</h4>
<p>Avoid <code>not</code> in your conditional. Prefer
<code>length collection &gt; threshold</code> rather than
<code>not (length collection &lt;= threshold)</code>. The former is
simpler to parse than the latter.</p>
<p>Applying this piece of advice is often impossible because libraries
don’t always export the needed values. Indeed, it is common for
collection libraries to export <code>is_empty</code> without
<code>has_at_least_one_element</code>.</p>
<p>Exporting multiple values without increasing the expressive power of
a library is often frowned upon: it bloats the interface, it increases
the footprint of the namespace, it requires additional maintenance.</p>
<p>Apply this advice when you can, but do not fret when you cannot. In
general, it is less important than ordering the branches of your
conditional.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let’s look back at the examples from the introduction, the pieces of
code that spun this whole thing. We can apply the advice above to make
the code more readable.</p>
<p><strong>Chaining options</strong>:</p>
<p>The original parsing of the directory option looked like this.</p>
<pre><code>let dir =
    match conf_dir () with
    | Some p -&gt; p
    | None -&gt; match cli_dir () with
        | None -&gt; def_dir
        | Some p -&gt; p</code></pre>
<p>It is difficult to read for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, abbreviations are obscure. This is partly alleviated by the
context in which the code originally appeared. Nonetheless, there is
litlle point in not spelling out that <code>dir</code> refers to a
directory and that <code>conf_</code> and <code>cli_</code> are prefixes
for configuration file and command line interface argument
respectively.</li>
<li>Second, the ordering of the pattern in the two <code>match</code>
constructs differ. This breaks structural parallelism and it makes the
tree mixed-heavy.</li>
</ul>
<p>More readable versions follow. In the first improved version, we
expand the variable names and we reorder the branches in the match
clauses.</p>
<pre><code>let directory =
    match directory_from_configuration () with
    | Some path -&gt; path
    | None -&gt; match directory_from_command_line () with
        | Some path -&gt; path
        | None -&gt; default_directory</code></pre>
<p>Note that the indentation can be confusing. Indeed, whilst
syntactically the expressions are nested, conceptually they are more
sequential.</p>
<pre><code>let directory =
    match directory_from_configuration () with
    | Some path -&gt; path
    | None -&gt;

    match directory_from_command_line () with
    | Some path -&gt; path
    | None -&gt;

    default_directory</code></pre>
<p>An even more readable version uses an abstraction to remove the
repetitive boilerplate.</p>
<pre><code>(* [&gt;||&gt;] separates multiple optional values and returns
   the left-most one (i.e., the first one) that is
   not [None].
   More formally: [None &gt;||&gt; f] is [f ()]
   and [Some v &gt;||&gt; _] is [v]. *)
let ( &gt;||&gt; ) o if_none = match o with
    | Some v -&gt; v
    | None -&gt; if_none ()

let dir =
    dir_from_configuration ()
    &gt;||&gt; fun () -&gt; dir_from_command_line_argument ()
    &gt;||&gt; fun () -&gt; default_dir</code></pre>
<p><strong>Initialisation</strong>:</p>
<p>The original code setting up the formatters was as follows.</p>
<pre><code>List.iter
    (fun (formatter, channel) -&gt;
        setup_formatter formatter
            (if is_a_tty channel then Ansi else Plain))
    [ (Format.std_formatter, Unix.stdout) ;
      (Format.err_formatter, Unix.stderr) ]</code></pre>
<p>The use of <code>List.iter</code> here is unnecessary. It actually
complicates the code both from a runtime point-of-view (the list with
its tuples is allocated and then traversed dynamically) and from a
syntactical point-of-view (the AST is deeper than the
<code>List.iter</code>-less version is wide).</p>
<p>The choice to use <code>List.iter</code> seem to have been driven by
the desire to avoid multiple syntactic calls to
<code>setup_formatter</code>, to avoid syntactic repetition. However,
repetition is completely acceptable and even makes sense when used
reasonably and consistently:</p>
<pre><code>let mode_of_channel channel =
    if is_a_tty channel then Ansi else Plain in
setup_formatter Format.std_formatter (mode_of_channel Unix.stdout);
setup_formatter Format.err_formatter (mode_of_channel Unix.stderr)</code></pre>
