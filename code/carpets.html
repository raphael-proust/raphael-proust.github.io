<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
<p>When I was little, I used to draw. Except, I was really bad at drawing so I would just take grid paper, …</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>… draw a rectangle on it, …</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>… start at one angle and draw a diagonal, …</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>… “bounce” on each side of the rectangle, …</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>… until reaching another angle.</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>I’d then do it again with a differently sized rectangle. And again and again.</p>
<p>I would sometime make a variation on the method by starting not at one of the angles, but somewhere along one of the edges.</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>I noticed that some rectangles filled up almost completely whilst others remained mostly blank.</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>And then one day my dad told me about primes and coprimes and how my drawings seem to relate to that. He thought I should explore the relationship and that maybe a computer was the way to do it. He bought Visual Basic: a cardboard box the size of a big book with a CD-ROM inside. The tutorial, included in the package, ran along the lines of:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This is how you make a window appear on screen</li>
<li>This is how you put a button on the window</li>
<li>This is how you make some text appear on the window when the button is clicked</li>
<li>Cool!</li>
</ol>
<p>So I kept filling up those rectangles by hand.</p>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>I’ve since learned to code. Here’s a basic implementation of the rectangle filling procedure.</p>
<p>IMPLEMENTATION</p>
<p>And a renderer to generate the images included in this post.</p>
