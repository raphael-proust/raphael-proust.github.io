## British pubs and their names

I was in a car, driving from Brighton to Cambridge. Just before leaving, I saw a
meme on my phone: an altered photo of a pub named *The Queen's head* but the
picture of the regent had been swapped for on of Freddy Mercury.

All along the trip, I kept noticing pubs and their names. They fell into a few
patterns. And they rely on a typical vocabulary.

The Queen's head  
The free press  
The swan and moon  
The duck and mallard  
The copper kettle  
The brass shovel  
And so on and so on

## A British pub name generator

I wrote [a British pub name generator](https://gitlab.com/raphael-proust/queenshead).
It is available through opam:

```
opam install queenshead
```

And it can generate British pub names:

```
$ queenshead
The rose and thrones
```

Read the help for more information.

```
$ queenshead --help
```
