## Tabletop Role Playing Games Titles

Amongst Tabletop Role Playing Games (TTRPGs), the most famous is Dungeons &
Dragons. The title itself is so iconic than any two aliterative words joined by
an ampersand sound like the name of another TTRPG.

Subways & Spiders  
Fjords & Fools  
Kindergartens & Crocodiles  
Atolls & Arthropods  
And so on and so on

You can actually find some similar-sounding titles in the wild.

## A TTRPG title generator

I wrote [a TTRPG title generator](https://gitlab.com/raphael-proust/areas-and-adversaries).
It is available through opam:

```
opam install areas-and-adversaries
```

And it can generate TTRPG titles:

```
$ areas-and-adversaries
Wagons & Warriors
```

Read the help for more information.

```
$ areas-and-adversaries --help
```
